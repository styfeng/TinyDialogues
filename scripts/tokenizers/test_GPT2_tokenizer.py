It is sometimes known as the long-tailed shrike, but this is to be discouraged, since it invites confusion with the long-tailed shrike, 'Lanius schach', of tropical southern Asia. The yellow-billed shrike is a common resident breeding bird in tropical Africa from Senegal eastwards to Uganda and locally in westernmost Kenya. It frequents forest and other habitats with trees.","**MOT**: just like your book at home \n\n **MOT**: do you wanna look at that it says look \n\n **MOT**: see \n\n **MOT**: there's a face with glass
