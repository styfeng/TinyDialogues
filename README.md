## Data

The TinyDialogues data can be found [here]([https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.03617](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11BwpCktJLHLP_h5xca21jh-OjHApA_tb?usp=sharing)). 'final_training_data' subfolder contains the final train and val splits. 'individual_age_data' subfolder contains the examples broken down by age, with a 'full_with_metadata' subfolder which contains the full examples including input parameters (e.g. number of participants) and additional GPT-4 generated metadata per example such as descriptions of the setting and other participants in each conversation.

## Remainder of the code and data will be released soon!
